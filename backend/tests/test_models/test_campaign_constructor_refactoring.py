1. Create CampaignDataValidator with reusable methods
2. Create CampaignDataCleaner for field corrections
3. Refactor constructor to use extracted components

REFACTOR PHASE - Optimize and clean up:
1. Ensure all characterization tests still pass
2. Optimize validator performance
3. Add comprehensive documentation

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ All existing tests pass without modification
✅ Constructor is more readable (not just shorter)
✅ Extracted components are genuinely reusable
✅ Error messages remain identical
✅ Performance doesn't degrade
✅ Debugging complexity doesn't increase

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
The goal is MEANINGFUL abstraction, not line count reduction.
Some constructor complexity is appropriate and should be preserved.
