"""
Upload Transaction Safety Tests - TDD for Data Consistency and Rollback Behavior

This test suite validates transaction safety and data consistency in the upload workflow,
specifically focusing on partial failure scenarios where some campaigns succeed and others fail.

Educational Focus: Shows how to test complex transaction scenarios in systems that process
multiple entities per request while maintaining ACID properties and proper error handling.

Testing Strategy:
1. Database transaction rollback testing for individual campaign failures
2. Partial success scenario validation (some campaigns save, others fail gracefully)
3. UploadSession consistency during mixed success/failure scenarios
4. Database constraint violation handling (duplicate IDs, foreign key violations)
5. Concurrent upload transaction isolation testing
6. Memory and resource cleanup after transaction failures

Transaction Safety Requirements:
- Individual campaign failures should not affect other campaigns in the same upload
- Database should never be left in inconsistent state
- UploadSession should accurately reflect actual database state
- Transaction rollback should be complete (no partial entity saves)
- Resource cleanup should occur even after transaction failures

TRANSACTION SAFETY TEST EXECUTION:

1. Run all transaction safety tests:
   pytest tests/test_api/test_upload_transaction_safety.py -v

2. Run specific categories:
   pytest tests/test_api/test_upload_transaction_safety.py -m transaction -v
   pytest tests/test_api/test_upload_transaction_safety.py -m concurrency -v

3. Run with database isolation:
   pytest tests/test_api/test_upload_transaction_safety.py --test-db-isolation -v

4. Run memory and resource tests:
   pytest tests/test_api/test_upload_transaction_safety.py::TestResourceCleanupTransactionSafety -v

WHAT THESE TRANSACTION TESTS VALIDATE:

1. **Individual Transaction Isolation**: Each campaign failure is isolated
2. **Batch Processing Safety**: Partial batch failures handled correctly
3. **Constraint Violation Handling**: Database constraints enforced properly
4. **Concurrent Upload Isolation**: Multiple uploads don't interfere
5. **Resource Cleanup**: No memory leaks or connection pool exhaustion
6. **Error Reporting Accuracy**: Errors reflect actual database state

CURRENT UPLOAD ENDPOINT TRANSACTION BEHAVIOR (Evidence-Based):

Based on code analysis of upload.py lines 296-332:

✅ GOOD TRANSACTION DESIGN:
- Individual campaign transactions (each campaign in try/catch block)
- Partial success support (valid campaigns saved, invalid ones skipped)
- Proper rollback on individual campaign failures (db.rollback() on line 314, 324)
- Comprehensive error collection and reporting
- UploadSession tracking of actual results

❌ POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED:
- Could benefit from explicit transaction boundaries documentation
- Error message consistency could be improved
- Performance optimization for large batches

EVIDENCE-BASED CONCLUSION:

The current upload endpoint transaction handling is WELL-DESIGNED:
- Proper isolation of individual campaign failures
- Comprehensive error handling and rollback
- Accurate state tracking via UploadSession
- Support for partial success scenarios

The architecture does NOT need extraction of "UploadOrchestrator".
Instead, these tests provide:
- Documentation of correct transaction behavior
- Regression protection during future changes
- Validation of the existing sound transaction design

REFACTORING RECOMMENDATION:

Focus on COMPREHENSIVE TESTING of the existing well-designed transaction handling,
not architectural changes that would complicate the clean transaction boundaries.
