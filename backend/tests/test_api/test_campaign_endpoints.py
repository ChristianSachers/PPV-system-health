Campaign API Endpoints TDD Template - Discovery-Driven API Testing

This template demonstrates:
1. FastAPI endpoint testing with file uploads
2. XLSX file processing integration testing
3. Error handling and validation at API level
4. Authentication and authorization patterns
5. Response format validation and API contract testing

Educational Focus: Shows how to use TDD for API endpoints where business
logic integration and file processing create complex integration scenarios.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR BACKEND-ENGINEER:

1. RED PHASE (Current State):
   - All tests skip due to missing FastAPI app
   - Tests document API contract requirements and discovery questions

2. GREEN PHASE (Implementation Steps):
   - Create FastAPI application with basic structure
   - Implement campaign upload endpoint with XLSX processing
   - Add campaign retrieval endpoints with filtering
   - Create analytics endpoints for dashboard data

3. REFACTOR PHASE:
   - Add comprehensive error handling and validation
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Optimize query performance for filtering and analytics
   - Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

DISCOVERY TDD APPROACH:
- Start with basic XLSX upload and storage
- Add campaign retrieval with essential filtering
- Implement analytics endpoints for dashboard needs
- Add comprehensive error handling and security

TESTING COMMANDS:
- Run: pytest tests/test_api/test_campaign_endpoints.py -v
- Test with real FastAPI app: pytest tests/test_api/ --api-integration
- Load testing: pytest tests/test_api/ --performance

API DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
- Use consistent response formats across all endpoints
- Implement proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- Add comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Consider pagination for large result sets
- Plan for authentication and authorization requirements
