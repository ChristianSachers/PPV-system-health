BusinessConstants TDD Template - Centralized Business Rule Constants Testing

This template demonstrates:
1. Constant value validation for business rules
2. Helper method testing for business logic centralization
3. Edge case discovery through boundary testing
4. Integration readiness with existing classification system

Educational Focus: Shows how to use TDD for validating centralized constants
and helper methods that will be used across the application to eliminate
hardcoded business rule duplication.

RED PHASE: These tests will fail until BusinessConstants is implemented.

# TDD GUIDANCE FOR BACKEND-ENGINEER

"""
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR BACKEND-ENGINEER:

1. RED PHASE (Current State):
   - All tests are skipped due to ImportError
   - Tests document expected BusinessConstants behavior
   - Run: pytest tests/test_constants/test_business.py -v --tb=short

2. GREEN PHASE (Implementation Steps):
   Create app/constants/business.py with:

   class BusinessConstants:
       CAMPAIGN_BUYER_VALUE = "Not set"

       @classmethod
       def is_campaign_buyer(cls, buyer) -> bool:
           if buyer is None:
               return False
           # Convert to string for defensive programming
           buyer_str = str(buyer) if not isinstance(buyer, str) else buyer
           return buyer_str == cls.CAMPAIGN_BUYER_VALUE

3. GREEN PHASE VALIDATION:
   - Run tests again: pytest tests/test_constants/test_business.py -v
   - All tests should pass
   - Verify edge cases are handled correctly

4. REFACTOR PHASE (After Green):
   - Consider making constants truly immutable (using __slots__ or properties)
   - Add type hints for better IDE support
   - Consider adding docstrings for business context

DISCOVERY TDD APPROACH:
- Start with the simplest constant definition
- Implement helper method with exact string matching
- Handle edge cases defensively (None, non-strings)
- Ensure perfect alignment with existing classification logic

TESTING COMMANDS:
- RED: pytest tests/test_constants/test_business.py -v (should skip all tests)
- GREEN: pytest tests/test_constants/test_business.py -v (should pass all tests)
- Integration: pytest tests/test_services/test_campaign_classifier.py tests/test_constants/test_business.py -v

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✓ All constant value tests pass
✓ All helper method tests pass
✓ All edge case tests pass
✓ Integration tests confirm compatibility
✓ Ready for refactoring existing hardcoded "Not set" strings

REFACTORING PREPARATION:
After BusinessConstants is implemented and tested, the following locations
can be safely refactored to use BusinessConstants.CAMPAIGN_BUYER_VALUE:
- Campaign model comparisons
- API endpoint filtering logic
- CampaignClassifier service
- Any other hardcoded "Not set" strings

This centralization eliminates the risk of typos and inconsistent business rules.
