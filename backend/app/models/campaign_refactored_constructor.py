# =============================================================================
# COMPARISON: CURRENT VS REFACTORED CONSTRUCTOR
# =============================================================================

"""
CONSTRUCTOR COMPLEXITY COMPARISON:
=================================

CURRENT CONSTRUCTOR (lines 67-132, ~65 lines):
- Single method with all validation logic inline
- Mixed concerns: data cleaning + validation + business rules
- Hard to test individual validation components
- All logic in one place (good for debugging, bad for reuse)

REFACTORED CONSTRUCTOR (~35 lines + extracted components):
- Data cleaning extracted to CampaignDataCleaner
- Reusable validations extracted to CampaignDataValidator
- Campaign-specific business rules remain in constructor
- Better separation of concerns, easier to test

BENEFITS OF REFACTORED APPROACH:
✅ Reusable validation components for other models
✅ Easier to test validation logic in isolation
✅ Better separation of data quality vs business logic
✅ More maintainable when requirements change
✅ Exact same behavior and error messages

POTENTIAL DRAWBACKS:
⚠️ More files to maintain (3 instead of 1)
⚠️ Slightly more complex debugging (multiple components)
⚠️ Need to ensure all components stay in sync

CONCLUSION:
The refactored approach provides real value through:
1. Genuine code reuse (UUID, positive number validation)
2. Better organization (cleaning vs validation vs business rules)
3. Improved testability (isolated component testing)
4. Future maintainability (easier to modify specific concerns)

This is MEANINGFUL abstraction, not just code movement.

# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION EXAMPLE
# =============================================================================

"""
HOW TO INTEGRATE THE REFACTORED CONSTRUCTOR:
===========================================

STEP 1: Replace Campaign.__init__() method:

# In app/models/campaign.py
from app.models.campaign_refactored_constructor import RefactoredCampaignConstructor

class Campaign(BaseModel, UUIDValidationMixin, CampaignBusinessRuleMixin):
    # ... all existing fields and methods ...

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        '''
        Initialize Campaign with business rule validation.

        Uses refactored constructor with extracted validation components.
        '''
        RefactoredCampaignConstructor.refactored_init(self, **kwargs)

STEP 2: Run characterization tests to ensure no behavior changes:
pytest tests/test_models/test_campaign_model.py::TestCampaignRuntimeParsingBehaviorLock -v

STEP 3: Run all existing tests to ensure backward compatibility:
pytest tests/test_models/test_campaign_model.py -v

STEP 4: If all tests pass, the refactoring is complete!

ROLLBACK PLAN:
If anything breaks, simply revert to the original constructor:
# Restore original __init__() method from version control

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
✅ All characterization tests pass
✅ All existing Campaign model tests pass
✅ All new validator tests pass
✅ Error messages remain identical
✅ Performance doesn't degrade
✅ Database behavior unchanged
