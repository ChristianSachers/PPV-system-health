I am a product manager and responsible for the programmatic public video tech-stack of a big advertisement company. While our Programmmatic public video (PPV) business has been growing for over 5 years already, technology has changed. At first, the business used an external AdServer. Three years ago, we decided to use our own tech-stack to be robust against other priorities for our external partner. We built a completely new AdServer. We tried our best to learn from the functionalities of the external partner and used a data driven approach to enhance the functionalities where necessary. Now we are in a situation where 100% of our PPV business uses our own technology.
Our PPV business is designed on a fixed price bases. This means, that even though our tech-stack and our auction system is capable of accepting different prices, the business reality is that we make the most amount of money if we simply fulfill every campaign and deal to 100%. This view on the business makes it our top most priority to ensure campaign and deal fulfillment across the board. On the other hand, the amount of opportunities to create playouts for the campaigns and deals is limited. We have multiple networks of screens that can be targeted on different granularities (Network, Region, City, Site).
So the job of our tech-stack is to handle all the campaigns and deals with their different parameters (Start Date&Time, End Date&Time, Priority, Impression Goal, Location targeting) and manage and map their needs to the opportunities presented by our inventory. To provide a perspective, we have roughly 15k screens that create up to 360 playouts per hour. Each playout has varying amounts of Impressions (This is because the screens are in public places, so the relation between playouts and impressions is 1:n). The AdServer is responsible and capable of matching between 100 and 500 campaigns and deals in parallel to the opportunities generated by the 15k screens. And the optimization task is to create the best fulfillment across all campaigns and deals. The rule is that any guaranteed campaign or deal must fulfill their goal (we would loose money otherwise) while unguaranteed campaigns or deals can fall short. Unguaranteed campaigns and deals should still reach their goal to the best of the availability.
The current situation is that our system has no transparency how good it is achieving this fulfillment goal. We need a way of monitoring the systems fulfillment status. Both overall and with ways to filter for specific demand types. This monitoring should use different time granularities like 7-days, 30-days and this-year. And provide absolut and relative numbers. Additionally rolling-time-window-trends are important to easily see if changes work well or create harm.
In the current situation it is unclear if the system is in a good state or not. The first goal of the system is to establish what the current baseline is. Based on the results, further deeper analysis will be needed. One idea is to identify campaigns and deals that have underperformed and to provide a deeper analysis of those specifically, for example by analysing their performance on specific sites and timeframes.
Any campaign and deal that is during it's runtime can't be included in the analysis as the data is incomplete. It can be included once the runtime has passed and the latest data is available.
The user for this application is a product manager with deep knowledge in the PPV domain. He has a background in computer science but has not touched any code in the last 10 years. He is a very visual learner and must be presented with comprehensive vizualizations. He is lazy and likes to have easy shortcuts, like clickable campaigns that automatically open deeper insights.
The data source for this system will be two things:
- Campaign information will be provided via an XLSX file as our campaign management system is not ready to provide API access.
  - Deal/Campaign name (2025_10147_0303_1_PV Promotion | UML | GIGA | CN-Autorinnen-Ausschreibung 2025	ASAP-30.06.2025)
  - Runtime	(ASAP-30.06.2025, 07.07.2025-24.07.2025)
  - Impression goal	(1-2000000000)
  - Budget € (2396690,38)
  - CPM €	(1,183)
  - Deal/Campaign ID (56cc787c-a703-4cd3-995a-4b42eb408dfb)
  - Buyer (DENTSU_AEGIS < Easymedia_rtb (Seat 608194) OR "Not set")
- The XLSX file with Campagin information will be provided via file-upload to the application by the user.
- Reporting Information will be provided via API
  - For the general overview:
    - For campaigns:
      - Core DSP Campaign ID (07ea0f2a-966c-4695-aee9-a39c76807cbf)
      - Core DSP Campaign Name (6257864_EXARING AG_Ströer Exaring Content 09 2025_25.08.-30.09._ > 6257864_RON_EXARING AG_Ströer Exaring Content 09 2025_01.09.-30.09._)
        - the Name can be structured with ">" indicating a Parent-Child structure. The Imporant part is always after the last ">"
        - If no ">" is available, this indicates that no Parent-Child structure exists and the name is correct as-is
      - Campaign Purchase Type (guaranteed OR unguaranteed)
      - Total Impressions (12.149,71)
        - for the general overview, this information is aggregated on the full campaign runtime
    - For deals:
      - Deal ID (d8622f94-b1c3-4892-ac14-7d27e3098731)
      - Deal Name (2025_30705_0032_2_Netzwerk_ZDH_MAIS | DHKT | Flight 3 | Trade_15.-27.09._)
        - Deal can't have any Parent-Child structure
      - Deal purchase Type (guaranteed OR unguaranteed)
      - Total Impressions (12.149,71)
        - for the general overview, this information is aggregated on the full deal runtime
  For detailed Analysis:
    - For both Campaigns and Deals
      - Date (2025-08-04T00:00:00.000Z)
        - granularity 1 hour
      - Site (München Hbf / U-Bf Public Video Station)
      - Total Impressions (8.233,51)
        - amount for the given 1-hour timeframe that starts at "Date"
      - Bids (194)
        - amount of times the system has selected the campaign or deal for the auction in the given timeframe
      - Auction Wins (14)
        - amount of times the campaign or deal has won the auction in the given timeframe
      - Sync Group Plays (20)
        - amount of times the auction resulted in a playouts in the given timeframe
  - The API endpoint will use a bearer token that will be provided on a "per-session" base by the user. The API uses URL parameters to specify the query.
As the application lifecylce is roughly 1-year. The data needs to be persisted between sessions. Consecutive uploads of campaign information must update the existing campaign information and only add new entries if UUID is not present, yet. The campagins XLSX does not differentiate between campaigns and deals, the reporting information does. So any entry in the XLSX file must be checked via the Deal/Campaign ID versus all existing Campaign IDs and Deal IDs in the application.

The application does not need a user-management or security system like passwords etc. 

This application is explorative and data analysis driven. The exact scope is not 100% clear at project start and will only become clear during development and once the tool is in use. It must be expected that any new data and any new analysis can change and add future requirements.
