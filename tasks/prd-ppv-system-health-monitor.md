# PRD: PPV System Health Monitor
*Discovery-Driven Development - Requirements will evolve through exploration*

## Introduction/Overview

The PPV System Health Monitor is a forensic analysis tool designed to investigate and understand the fulfillment performance of our programmatic public video ad serving system. Rather than managing active campaigns, this tool performs retrospective analysis on completed campaigns and deals to identify system performance patterns, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities.

**Core Problem:** Currently, there is no transparency into whether our ad serving system achieves optimal impression delivery fulfillment. We need to establish baseline fulfillment metrics comparing delivered impressions against impression goals to discover patterns that indicate delivery performance issues.

**Key Insight:** The system's primary purpose is FULFILLMENT ANALYSIS - measuring how well campaigns and deals achieve their impression goals, not budget or CPM optimization.

**Target User:** Product Manager with deep PPV domain knowledge and CS background, requiring visual data exploration tools with clickable insights for deeper investigation.

## Discovery Goals

### Primary Hypotheses to Test:
1. **100% Fulfillment Hypothesis:** Guaranteed campaigns and deals should achieve 100% impression delivery (Delivered ‚â• Impression Goal) when sufficient opportunity exists
2. **DSP Interference Hypothesis:** Deal underperformance may correlate with DSP bidding cessation rather than system delivery failures
3. **Delivery Opportunity Hypothesis:** System failures can be proven by demonstrating adequate inventory opportunity existed but impressions weren't delivered to meet goals
4. **Fulfillment Pattern Hypothesis:** Impression delivery shortfall patterns exist across temporal, geographic, or campaign parameter dimensions

### Learning Success Criteria:
- Ability to prove when system had adequate opportunity but failed to deliver impression goals (shortfall analysis)
- Clear identification of guaranteed vs. unguaranteed impression delivery performance gaps
- Discovery of actionable fulfillment patterns that point to specific delivery system improvements
- Establishment of quantitative impression delivery baseline for future fulfillment performance comparison

**Success Metrics:** Fulfillment Rate = (Delivered Impressions / Impression Goal) √ó 100%

## Investigation Workflows

### Phase 1: Overall Health Assessment (Weeks 1-2)
**Visual Learning Journey:**
```

## Discovery Constraints

### Safe Exploration Boundaries:
- **Historical Data Only:** No real-time components or live campaign modifications
- **Read-Only Analysis:** No data modification capabilities, only aggregation and visualization
- **Completed Campaigns Only:** Analysis restricted to campaigns/deals past their end date with complete data
- **Single User System:** No multi-user management or authentication requirements

### Data Integrity Safeguards:
- UUID immutability for campaign/deal identification
- Validation of data completeness before analysis inclusion
- Clear differentiation between campaigns and deals based on buyer field logic

1. **Baseline Establishment:** Quantify current fulfillment performance across all dimensions
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Identify statistical outliers and performance clusters
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Test relationships between performance and various campaign/deal attributes
4. **Opportunity Analysis:** Compare delivered impressions against available inventory opportunities

### Data Exploration Safety:
- All analysis performed on static historical datasets
- No impact on live ad serving system
- Comprehensive data validation before analysis inclusion

## Technical Foundation

### Core Infrastructure Requirements:
1. **Data Processing Pipeline:**
   - XLSX parsing and validation
   - API data integration and aggregation
   - UUID-based relationship management between campaign and reporting data

   - Session-independent data persistence

3. **Visualization Engine:**
   - Interactive dashboard framework
   - Multiple chart types and filtering capabilities
   - Drill-down functionality for detailed investigation

### Integration Specifications:
- **Campaign Data:** XLSX file format with predefined schema
  - **Impression Goal:** Single INTEGER field (1 to 2,000,000,000) - NOT a range string
  - **Runtime:** Single TEXT field format "START_DATE-END_DATE" where START_DATE can be "ASAP"
  - **Core Fields:** campaign_id (UUID), campaign_name, impression_goal (INTEGER), runtime (TEXT), buyer
- **Reporting Data:** REST API with bearer token authentication
- **Time Granularity:** Hourly reporting data aggregated to various time windows
- **Geographic Granularity:** Site-level performance analysis capabilities

### CRITICAL DATA STRUCTURE CORRECTIONS:
**‚ùå INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS (DO NOT IMPLEMENT):**
- Impression goal as range string "1-2000000000"
- Separate start_date and end_date fields
- Primary focus on Budget and CPM analysis
- Complex budget optimization workflows

**‚úÖ CORRECT DATA STRUCTURE:**
- **impression_goal:** INTEGER field containing concrete target (e.g., 1500000)
- **runtime:** TEXT field containing "14.01.2025-26.01.2025" or "ASAP-14.12.2025"
- **Primary Analysis:** Fulfillment Rate = (delivered_impressions / impression_goal) √ó 100%
- **Core Workflow:** Identify campaigns/deals with fulfillment rate < 100%
