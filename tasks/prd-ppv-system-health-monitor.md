# PRD: PPV System Health Monitor
*Discovery-Driven Development - Requirements will evolve through exploration*

## Introduction/Overview

The PPV System Health Monitor is a forensic analysis tool designed to investigate and understand the fulfillment performance of our programmatic public video ad serving system. Rather than managing active campaigns, this tool performs retrospective analysis on completed campaigns and deals to identify system performance patterns, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities.

**Core Problem:** Currently, there is no transparency into whether our ad serving system achieves optimal campaign fulfillment. We need to establish baseline performance metrics and discover patterns that indicate system health issues.

**Target User:** Product Manager with deep PPV domain knowledge and CS background, requiring visual data exploration tools with clickable insights for deeper investigation.

## Discovery Goals

### Primary Hypotheses to Test:
1. **100% Fulfillment Hypothesis:** Guaranteed campaigns and deals should achieve 100% impression delivery when sufficient opportunity exists
2. **DSP Interference Hypothesis:** Deal underperformance may correlate with DSP bidding cessation rather than system failures
3. **Opportunity vs. Performance Hypothesis:** System failures can be proven by demonstrating adequate inventory opportunity existed but wasn't utilized
4. **Pattern Recognition Hypothesis:** Underperformance patterns exist across temporal, geographic, or campaign parameter dimensions

### Learning Success Criteria:
- Ability to prove when system had adequate opportunity but failed to deliver 100% fulfillment
- Clear identification of guaranteed vs. unguaranteed performance gaps
- Discovery of actionable patterns that point to specific system improvements
- Establishment of quantitative baseline for future system performance comparison

## Investigation Workflows

### Phase 1: Overall Health Assessment (Weeks 1-2)
